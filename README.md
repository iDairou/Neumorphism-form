### Neumoporphism?

Neumorphic design is a visual trend that has gained traction with UI/UX designers and become a popular aesthetic choice for contemporary software, websites, and mobile apps.

### Project assumption:
The main goal of this project was to practice and improve skills in building an app with a **styled-components** solution. It's a React-specific CSS-in-JS styling solution that creates a platform for developers to write actual CSS code to style React components.

### Features:

- **Neumorphic design**
- **Progression is visualized by a progress bar**
- **Validation at every step of the form**
- **Easily moving through steps, without losing entries**
- **At the last stage, we have a summary page where you can check all your entries**
   - **The form is generated from the array in [formSettings.js](https://github.com/iDairou/Neumorphism-form/blob/main/src/Helpers/formSettings.js). There you can see all the fields with specific patterns, errors, or names. This solution allows me to add some other fields without interrupting deep JS code**
